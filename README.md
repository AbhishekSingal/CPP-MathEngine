## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Expression Parser**  
  Parses algebraic expressions (e.g., `3*x^2 + xy + y^2 + x^2`)
  Combine Like-Terms , expand any polynomial to any power
  Multiply Complex Expression like ((ax+by+cz)*(4d+5z+1)^2)/(2)

- 🧠 **Expression Evaluation**  
  Supports numeric and symbolic evaluation, nested operations, and standard mathematical functions.

- 🧩 **Variable Handling**  
  Dynamically assign and evaluate variables, e.g., `x = 5`, `y = 2*x + 3`.

- 🔁 **Operator Precedence & Accuracy**  
  Implements correct mathematical order of operations using stack-based parsing.

- 🧰 **Extendable Architecture**  
  Easily add new functions or operators with minimal code changes.

- 🧾 **Error Handling**  
  Gracefully handles invalid syntax, undefined variables, and mathematical errors.
